These two quotes from Peter Kreeft's book *Heaven, the Heart's Deepest Longing* came in my email from [Daily Catholic Wisdom](https://catholicwisdom.org/). I think they are important for thinking about how we live our lives. Are we only looking for things that will gratify us in this life, or are we seeking something that gives our lives ultimate meaning? Jesus said, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36)

> God is a gentleman and will not force heaven on anyone who says, ‘No thank you’. Implied in the encouraging words ‘seek and you shall find’ is a dire warning: If you do not seek, you will not find. Earth is automatic, but heaven is freely chosen and therefore can be freely refused.

> Only God is guaranteed. All who seek him find him. But only those who seek him find him: ‘You will seek me and find me; when you seek me with all your heart, I will be found by you, says the Lord.’ Finding him is heaven. Seeking him is heaven’s door. Not finding him is hell, and not seeking is the door to hell. The road to hell is not paved with good intentions but with no intentions, with ‘I don’t give a damn’ or ‘the hell with it’.
