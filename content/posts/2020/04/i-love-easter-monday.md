Yesterday was Easter Monday. For me, the build up of Holy Week and the Easter Triduum, climaxing on Easter Sunday is exhausting. I feel like there are so many things we want to get done on those days that it can be hard to squeeze them all in. I am blessed that I get Holy Thursday through Easter Monday off from work, so on Easter Monday, I can relax and reflect on the previous week.

On Easter I started what I hope will become a daily practice of visiting the local parish church. The side door is unlocked during the day, allowing people to come in and pray, although they ask that there be no more than ten at a time. If we can't gather for Mass or receive communion, at least I can come and spend some time where the blessed sacrament is kept in the tabernacle.

What motivated me to start these visits is a book a started reading several days ago called *In Sinu Jesu: When Heart Speaks to Heart &mdash; The Journal of a Priest at Prayer* written by an anonymous Benedictine priest. It focuses on the importance of recognizing the presence of Jesus in the sacrament. This priest gets a call from Jesus to spend time in the presence of the sacrament to make up for the fact that many priests today ignore Jesus' sacramental presence. It is quite compelling, and it is drawing me into wanting to spend more time with Jesus in this way.

I taught the 6th grade computer science class today. They are a lot of fun, but they are also an exercise in patience as I repeatedly get questions that should not need to be asked if they had paid attention to the video and instructions I gave them. However, I realize that all of us are this way, and it's especially sad when we don't pay attention to God's instructions that can affect how we spend eternity. The little boys are only less sophisticated in their inattention than we are, but we all have the same problem.
