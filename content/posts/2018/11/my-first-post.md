I discovered blogging in 2001 with Dave Winer's [Radio Userland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand) software. I played around with a few blog ideas using Radio and then tried other blogging software before finally settling down on Blogger, where my old [Scriptorium](https://greggraham.blogspot.com) blog still resides. If you look at it, you will see that although it goes back to 2003, not much has been done there lately.

For some time I've been wanting to move off of Blogger to a static website system using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), but now I decided to bite the bullet, make a decision, and setup this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It is a nerdy way to make a website, but that's nothing new for me.

I hope you enjoy my new site!
